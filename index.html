            How can we help children in underdeveloped countries to obtain an education
            through motivating them to stay in school? How might we help them shape a future?

            How could we make education interesting and motivating?
            <br /> Children in all parts of the world are suffering from the pandemic,
            however about 9.7 million children are in danger of not returning to school after the pandemic. <br>
            There are many causes for that, all depending on where they reside. Some children are forced to work
            to help their family economically through tough times, others may lack motivation because of bad teaching or lack thereof.
            <br>
            There are 130 million children across the world that attend school yet has not
            learned how to read, write or do math. What this shows is that either the teachers struggle teaching their
            students, or in some cases the students might lack concentration. In some cases, this could be because of full classes. On the other hand it could be because the
            teacher does not see the point in teaching when they get paid for being there anyways. A lot of teachers in
            third world countries does not really have the competence to teach either, which also cause students to drop out.
